# William Beckham 👋 
**Military Veteran | 4.0 GPA Systems Security & Analysis | Strategic Analyst**

### 🛡️ Professional Profile
I am a technical specialist focusing on **Systems Security & Analysis**. My professional foundation is built on 
**U.S. Army service (13B/38B)**, the **DOD Pathfinder Project**, and a rigorous academic record. 
I specialize in technical documentation, operational security, and the stability of critical systems.

- 🎓 **Academic Excellence:** 4.0 GPA | President’s List (Fall 2023, Spring 2025, Fall 2025)
- 📜 **Security Focus:** Finalizing degree requirements; preparing for **CompTIA Security+** and **CySA+**.
- 🌍 **Global Context:** 8 years of cultural residency in Okinawa, Japan; two combat deployments to Afghanistan.
- 📂 **Experience:** AI Data Analyst for the **DOD Pathfinder Project** (2024-2025).

### 🚀 Final Semester Milestones (Spring 2026)
Executing my final 12 credit hours with a focus on offensive and defensive security operations:
- **SEC-285:** Systems Security Capstone (Technical Writing & GRC)
- **CCT-250:** Network Vulnerabilities I (Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing)
- **CIS-115:** Algorithm Design & Program Logic
- **CSC-113:** AI-Enhanced Workflows & Prompt Engineering

### ⚙️ Systems & Hardware Engineering
I approach cybersecurity from the hardware up, specializing in enthusiast-grade architecture and thermal management:
- **Architecture:** Ryzen 9 7900X @ 5.25GHz (Stable) | ASUS ROG Crosshair X870E Hero
- **Cooling:** Custom open-loop liquid cooling (Full EKWB blocks and radiators)
- **Specifications:** 64GB DDR5-5600 | RTX 4080 16GB 

### 🎲 Strategic Analysis & Tabletop Theory
Outside of the terminal, I analyze tactical scenarios through **Bolt Action** and **Victory at Sea**. 
These simulations focus on squad-level logistics and naval fleet maneuvers, 
requiring the same rapid risk assessment and resource management found in modern **Incident Response** and **Threat Hunting**.
