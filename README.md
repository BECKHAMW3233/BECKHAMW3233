# William Beckham 👋 
**Military Veteran | 4.0 GPA Systems Security & Analysis | Tactical Systems Builder**

### 🛡️ Professional Profile
Technical specialist in **Systems Security & Analysis** with a background in **U.S. Army Civil Affairs (38B)** and **Field Artillery (13B)**. 
I specialize in technical documentation, operational security, and high-performance hardware architecture.
My approach is defined by a **perfect 4.0 GPA** and a commitment to mission-ready system stability.

- 🎓 **Academic Excellence:** 4.0 GPA | President’s List (Fall 2023, Spring 2025, Fall 2025)
- 📜 **Security Focus:** Finalizing degree requirements; preparing for **CompTIA Security+** and **CySA+**.
- 🌍 **Global Context:** 8 years of residency in Okinawa, Japan; two combat deployments to Afghanistan.
- 📂 **Experience:** AI Data Analyst for the **DOD Pathfinder Project** (2024-2025).

### 🚀 Final Semester Milestones (Spring 2026)
Executing my final 12 credit hours with a focus on offensive and defensive security operations:
- **SEC-285:** Systems Security Capstone (Technical Writing & GRC)
- **CCT-250:** Network Vulnerabilities I (Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing)
- **CIS-115:** Algorithm Design & Program Logic
- **CSC-113:** AI-Enhanced Workflows & Prompt Engineering

### ⚙️ Systems & Hardware Engineering
I approach cybersecurity from the hardware up, specializing in enthusiast-grade architecture and thermal management.
My workstation is a custom benchmark for stability:
- **Architecture:** Ryzen 9 7900X @ 5.25GHz (Stable) | ASUS ROG Crosshair X870E Hero
- **Cooling:** Custom closed-loop liquid cooling (EKWB blocks and radiators)
- **Specifications:** 64GB DDR5-5600 | RTX 4080 16GB (Air-Cooled)

### ⚔️ Tabletop Strategy & Miniature Wargaming
Outside of the terminal, I apply tactical theory through physical tabletop wargaming.
These hobbies require the same meticulous attention to detail, logistics, and resource management found in Incident Response.

#### **Bolt Action (28mm Scale)**
A physical, squad-based WWII tactical game played with detailed miniatures.
- **Tactical Logic:** Focuses on platoon-level maneuvers and troop morale.
- **Strategic Constraint:** Missions are strictly limited to **6 rounds**,
- requiring rapid decision-making and efficient objective prioritization under a "fog of war" activation system.

#### **Victory at Sea (1:1800 Scale)**
A physical naval combat game focusing on fleet-level maneuvers and ship-to-ship engagements.
- **Logistical Complexity:** Requires managing initiative and the health of critical ship systems (engines, bridge, gunnery).
- **Scale Detail:** High-precision maneuvers where positioning and firing arcs are measured to the millimeter,
  mirroring the "low-tolerance" environment of network security.
