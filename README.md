* **Motherboard**: ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero (Rev 1.xx)
* **RAM**: 64GB DDR5 5600 (air cooled)
* **GPU**: Zotac RTX 4080 16GB (air cooled)
* **PSU**: 850W+ certified
* **Case**: Thermaltake Core P8

**Cooling System:**
* **CPU**: Custom closed-loop with EKWB Velocity 2 block
* **Radiator**: EKWB XE 360mm (60mm thick)
* **Pump**: DDC with soft tubing configuration
* **OS**: Windows 11 Pro (Build 26200.7623)

## 🤖 AI Infrastructure & Data Sovereignty
Maintaining complete operational security through local AI deployment:

**Platform**: Ollama v0.14.0 with AnythingLLM v1.8.4 interface  
**Model Library** (150+ GB deployed):
* **Qwen3:32B** (20 GB) - Primary analysis and documentation
* **Llama3.1:70B** (42 GB) - Advanced reasoning (quantized q4_K_M)
* **DeepSeek R1:32B** (19 GB) - Specialized reasoning tasks
* **DeepSeek-Coder:33B** (18 GB) - Programming and code analysis
* **CyberSecurity Threat Analysis V2** (4.7 GB) - Security specialized
* **BlackHat Hacker V2** (9.2 GB) - Penetration testing focused

**Performance**: 3-5 tokens/second processing with complete data sovereignty

## ⚔️ Tabletop Strategy & Miniature Wargaming
Outside of the terminal, I apply tactical theory through physical tabletop wargaming. These hobbies require the same meticulous attention to detail, logistics, and resource management found in Incident Response.

**Bolt Action (28mm Scale)**  
A physical, squad-based WWII tactical game played with detailed miniatures.
* **Tactical Logic**: Focuses on platoon-level maneuvers and troop morale
* **Strategic Constraint**: Missions limited to 6 rounds, requiring rapid decision-making and efficient objective prioritization under "fog of war" activation system

**Victory at Sea (1:1800 Scale)**  
A physical naval combat game focusing on fleet-level maneuvers and ship-to-ship engagements.
* **Logistical Complexity**: Managing initiative and critical ship systems (engines, bridge, gunnery)
* **Scale Detail**: High-precision maneuvers where positioning and firing arcs are measured to the millimeter, mirroring the low-tolerance environment of network security
